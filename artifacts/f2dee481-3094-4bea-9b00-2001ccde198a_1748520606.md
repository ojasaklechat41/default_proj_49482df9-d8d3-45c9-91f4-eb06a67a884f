# Technical Requirements Artifact

### Technical Specifications

#### 1. Core Services:
- **LLM Integration**: Ability to integrate with large language models for providing intelligent development assistance.
- **Artifact Management**: Store, retrieve, and manage artifacts with version control and efficient data handling.

#### 2. API Layer:
- **Framework**: FastAPI (latest stable version).
- **Endpoints**: RESTful architecture covering CRUD operations for projects and agents, along with artifact management.
- **Real-Time Communication**: Implementation of WebSocket for real-time updates.

#### 3. Data Storage:
- **Primary Storage**: GitHub-based storage for artifact persistence.
- **Version Control**: Utilize GitHub features for versioning of artifacts including semantic versioning.

#### 4. Security:
- **Authentication**: Implement JWT-based security for API endpoints.

### Technical Requirements
- **Backend**:
  - Programming Language: Python 3.10 or higher
  - Framework: FastAPI
  - ORM: SQLAlchemy
  - Data Validation: Pydantic
  - HTTP Client: aiohttp for asynchronous requests
  - GitHub Integration: PyGithub v2.1.1

- **Frontend** (Planned):
  - Framework: React 18
  - Language: TypeScript
  - Styling: Tailwind CSS
  - WebSocket support for real-time UI updates

- **Infrastructure**:
  - Containerization: Docker
  - Orchestration: Kubernetes
  - CI/CD: GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment
  - Monitoring: Prometheus for metric collection and Grafana for visualization.

### Constraints
- **Performance**: Rate limiting on API endpoints to handle traffic. 
- **Error Handling**: Robust error recovery mechanisms in place to enhance user experience and system reliability.
- **Documentation**: Ongoing updates required for API documentation, especially with the addition of new features.

### Dependencies
- **Current Versions**:
  - FastAPI: latest stable version
  - Pydantic: v1.x (planned migration to v2)
  - github.py: v2.1.1
  - python-dotenv: For environment variable management
  - aiohttp: For asynchronous HTTP operations

### Development Goals
- **High Priority Goals**:
  - Implement artifact diff visualization to enhance user productivity.
  - Support for binary artifacts to cater to diverse artifact types.
  - Further enhance error recovery mechanisms to improve resilience.
  - Improve API documentation for better usability and developer experience.

- **Technical Debt**:
  - Refactor existing error handling to ensure consistency and reliability.
  - Add comprehensive tests across all modules for better code quality assurance.
  - Improve logging for better observability.
  - Update and standardize project documentation to reflect current architecture and features.

### Future Considerations
- **Webhooks**: Incorporate webhook integrations for automated notifications on artifact updates.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement logging and monitoring solutions for tracking API performance and error metrics.
- **Performance Optimization**: Analyze and optimize backend processes for improved response times and resource usage.

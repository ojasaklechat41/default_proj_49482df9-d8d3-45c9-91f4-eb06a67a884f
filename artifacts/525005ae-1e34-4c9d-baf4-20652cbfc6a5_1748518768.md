## Product Requirements Document for Artifact Versioning System

### Overview
The Artifact Versioning System is a crucial feature of the AI-Powered Development Assistant project. It aims to facilitate the management of artifact versions, improve collaboration among developers, and enhance the overall usability of the artifact management system.

### Objectives
- To implement a robust versioning system for artifacts stored in GitHub.
- To enable effective tracking and management of changes to artifacts.
- To provide a user-friendly interface for viewing differences between versions.

### Requirements

#### Functional Requirements
1. **Version Control**
   - Each artifact must be automatically versioned upon creation or update.
   - The system must store metadata including version number, timestamp, author, and change description.

2. **Artifact Diff Visualization**
   - Implement a feature that allows users to compare different versions of an artifact and visualize the differences.
   - Support both textual and binary artifacts for comparison.

3. **Automatic Refresh**
   - Automatically refresh the list of artifacts and their versions when changes are made.
   
4. **User Interface**
   - Create a user-friendly interface for listing versions of artifacts.
   - Provide buttons/controls for selecting versions to view differences, restore previous versions, or delete older versions.

5. **Error Handling**
   - Implement robust error recovery mechanisms to gracefully handle GitHub API errors and other potential issues.
   - Notify users via the UI when an error occurs during an operation.

6. **Integration with GitHub**
   - Leverage existing GitHub integration to ensure that all version changes are persisted automatically in the associated GitHub repository.
   - Support both manual and automatic commits to GitHub based on user preferences.

#### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**
   - Ensure that artifact versioning operations (CRUD) respond within 500 milliseconds under normal load conditions.
   
2. **Security**
   - Implement JWT-based authentication for secure access to the artifact versioning features.
   - Ensure that different user roles have appropriate permissions for viewing, creating, and modifying artifacts.
   
3. **Scalability**
   - The system should be designed to handle a growing number of artifacts and users without degradation in performance.

4. **Documentation**
   - Provide comprehensive API documentation detailing the endpoints related to artifact versioning.
   - Include user documentation for navigating and utilizing the artifact versioning features.

5. **Testing**
   - Comprehensive unit and integration tests must be established covering all new features and integrations.

### User Stories

1. **As a Developer,** I want to create a new artifact and have it automatically versioned, so that I can keep track of all changes I make over time.

2. **As a Developer,** I want to view a list of all versions of an artifact, so that I can understand the history of changes and decisions made.

3. **As a Developer,** I want to compare the differences between two versions of an artifact, so that I can review changes quickly and effectively before making updates.

4. **As a Developer,** I want the option to restore a previous version of an artifact, so that I can easily revert changes if needed.

5. **As a Team Lead,** I want to monitor and audit changes made to artifacts, so that I can oversee team contributions and collaboration efficiently.

6. **As a User,** I want to receive meaningful error messages if an operation fails, so that I can understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

7. **As a User,** I want to manually trigger a refresh of the artifact list, so that I can ensure I'm viewing the most up-to-date information.

8. **As a Developer,** I want comprehensive documentation on how to use the artifact versioning feature, so that I can onboard new team members and improve my own understanding of the system.

### Success Metrics
- Reduction in the number of issues related to artifact management and versioning.
- User satisfaction score following the release of the feature (target: 85% or higher).
- Successful completion of all user stories and functional requirements within the sprint timeline.

### Dependencies
- Ensure compatibility with updated dependencies, particularly FastAPI and Pydantic v2.
- Integrate with the current GitHub API setup for effective version control.
- Collaborate with frontend developers to ensure seamless integration of WebSocket updates for real-time feedback on artifact versions.

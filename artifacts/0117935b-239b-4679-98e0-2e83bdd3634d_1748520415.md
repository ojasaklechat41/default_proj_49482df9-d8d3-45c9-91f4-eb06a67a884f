# AI-Powered Development Assistant - High-Level System Architecture

## 1. Core Components

### A. Core Services
- **LLM Integration**: Leverages large language models for providing intelligent assistance in software development tasks, such as code suggestions, debugging help, and documentation generation.
- **Artifact Management**: Handles version-controlled storage and retrieval of development artifacts using GitHub as the backend storage.

### B. API Layer
- **FastAPI-based REST endpoints**: Provides a clean, documented API for interacting with core services, allowing developers to perform operations such as project management, artifact access, and agent interactions.

### C. Storage
- **GitHub-based Artifact Storage**: Utilizes GitHub API for persisting artifacts and maintaining version history. This component ensures that artifacts can be stored, retrieved, and managed efficiently.

### D. Authentication
- **JWT-based Security**: API access is secured using JSON Web Tokens, enabling safe and authenticated requests from clients.

## 2. Infrastructure Components

### A. Backend Stack
- **Python 3.10+**: Core programming language used for the backend development.
- **FastAPI**: Framework for building APIs that are easily accessible and high-performance.
- **SQLAlchemy ORM**: For ORM capabilities to interact with the database, should persistent storage be needed beyond GitHub.
- **Pydantic**: For data validation and settings management.
- **GitHub API Integration**: Interfaces with GitHub for artifact management.

### B. Frontend (Planned)
- **React 18**: The main library for building user interfaces for the assistant.
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe JavaScript development.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling the frontend.
- **WebSocket**: For real-time updates to the user interface.

### C. DevOps and CI/CD
- **Docker Containers**: Containerization of the application for consistency across environments.
- **Kubernetes Orchestration**: For managing containerized applications and scaling them as needed.
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD**: Continuous integration and delivery pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
- **Prometheus + Grafana**: Monitoring solution for tracking performance metrics and system health.

## 3. Development Focus Areas

### A. Current Development
- Improving artifact management features such as versioning, refresh capabilities, and a content-based diffing approach for efficient retrieval.
- Enhancing the authentication and API layers, implementing real-time updates via WebSocket.

### B. Future Development
- Building visualization tools for artifact diffs.
- Supporting binary artifact storage.
- Expanding error recovery mechanisms and comprehensive logging implementation.
- Updating technical documentation and adding thorough tests to bolster reliability.

### C. Technical Debt Management
- Addressing refactoring needs, particularly around error handling.
- Improving logging for better traceability of events and errors.

### D. Dependencies to Update
- Ensuring that FastAPI and Pydantic libraries are up-to-date along with addressing any necessary security patches in the framework or libraries used.

## 4. Next Development Sprint Goals
- Prioritize the implementation of artifact diff visualization and binary artifact support.
- Enhance overall error recovery processes.
- Update and improve API documentation to ensure clarity for developers. 

By adhering to this architecture and planned goals, the AI-Powered Development Assistant will evolve into a comprehensive tool, aiding developers in managing their workflows more effectively.

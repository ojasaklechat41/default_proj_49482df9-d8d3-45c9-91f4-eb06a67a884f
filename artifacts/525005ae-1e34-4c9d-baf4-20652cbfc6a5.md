# Product Requirements Artifact

To provide you with comprehensive product requirements and user stories effectively, I need more context about the specific feature you're referring to. However, I will outline a general template that can be utilized for various features. Please feel free to fill in relevant details or adjust this template based on your specific needs.

### Feature: User Account Management System

#### Product Requirements:

1. **User Registration**
   - The system must allow new users to register using an email address and password.
   - Registration should include fields for first name, last name, email address, password, and confirm password.
   - The system must validate the email format and ensure that the password meets security requirements (e.g., minimum length, include special characters).

2. **User Login**
   - Users should be able to log into their account using their registered email address and password.
   - The system must implement the ability to handle incorrect login attempts with appropriate messages.

3. **Password Recovery**
   - Users must have a way to recover their password through a "Forgot Password?" link that triggers an email with password reset instructions.
   - The password reset link must expire after a set period for security reasons.

4. **Profile Management**
   - Users must be able to edit their profile information (e.g., first name, last name, email address).
   - The system must require users to verify their email address upon updating it.

5. **Account Deactivation**
   - Users must have the option to deactivate their account, which should lead to the removal of their data from the system after a grace period for reactivation.

6. **Security**
   - The system must store passwords securely using hashing algorithms.
   - 2-Factor Authentication (2FA) should be implemented as an optional security measure during login.

7. **User Roles and Permissions**
   - The system should support different user roles (e.g., Admin, Regular User) with different levels of access.
   - Admin users should have the capability to manage user accounts, including viewing and modifying user data.

8. **Performance and Scalability**
   - The system must handle up to 10,000 concurrent users without performance degradation.
   - Response time for registration and login should be under 2 seconds.

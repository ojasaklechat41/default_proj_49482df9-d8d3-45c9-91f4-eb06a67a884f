### Comprehensive Product Requirements and User Stories for Data Pipeline in Java with Snowflake

#### Overview
Atomic Works is planning to transition data storage from Amazon S3 to Snowflake and requires a robust data pipeline setup in a Java-based project. This document outlines the product requirements and user stories to facilitate this transition and set up a Proof of Concept (POC) with Snowflake.

### Product Requirements

#### 1. Data Ingestion
- **Requirement**: The system must be able to ingest data from various sources, including existing data in S3 and potentially real-time data streams.
  - **Sub-requirement**: Support for batch and streaming ingestion.
  - **Sub-requirement**: Implement connectors to read data from locations such as S3, relational databases, and REST APIs.

#### 2. Data Transformation
- **Requirement**: Implement data transformation processes (ETL/ELT) within the pipeline.
  - **Sub-requirement**: Support for data cleansing, normalization, and transformation using Java-based processing frameworks (e.g., Apache Spark).
  - **Sub-requirement**: Allow for modular transformation scripts that can be added or modified without affecting the entire pipeline.

#### 3. Data Storage
- **Requirement**: Store transformed data in Snowflake with efficient data warehouse capabilities.
  - **Sub-requirement**: Support for bulk and incremental loading of data into Snowflake.
  - **Sub-requirement**: Maintain data integrity and support schema evolution.

#### 4. Data Access
- **Requirement**: Provide access controls and permissions for different users accessing data in Snowflake.
  - **Sub-requirement**: Integration with identity and access management services for role-based access control.

#### 5. Monitoring and Logging
- **Requirement**: Implement logging and monitoring of the data pipeline to track performance and errors.
  - **Sub-requirement**: Use monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to visualize metrics.
  - **Sub-requirement**: Send alerts for failure or unexpected performance drops.

#### 6. Documentation and User Support
- **Requirement**: Provide comprehensive documentation for the data pipeline setup and usage.
  - **Sub-requirement**: Include tutorials for onboarding new developers and data engineers.
  - **Sub-requirement**: Provide troubleshooting guidelines for common issues.

### User Stories

#### User Story 1: As a data engineer
- **Goal**: I want to ingest data from Amazon S3 into Snowflake securely and reliably.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Connection to S3 is established correctly.
  - Data can be ingested in batch mode.
  - Data integrity is maintained during the transfer.

#### User Story 2: As a data engineer
- **Goal**: I want to transform data before loading it into Snowflake to ensure the dataset is clean and usable.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Implement transformation scripts that can be executed as part of the pipeline.
  - Verify that transformed data meets the desired quality standards.

#### User Story 3: As a data analyst
- **Goal**: I want to access data stored in Snowflake to conduct analysis and generate reports.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Access to Snowflake is restricted based on user roles.
  - Data can be queried without performance issues.

#### User Story 4: As a project manager
- **Goal**: I want to monitor the data pipeline's performance and troubleshoot any failures efficiently.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Dashboard shows real-time performance metrics.
  - Alerts are generated and sent to the necessary team members during failures.

#### User Story 5: As a new developer
- **Goal**: I want comprehensive documentation for the data pipeline to understand its functionality and my role within it.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Documentation is clear, concise, and accessible.
  - Includes setup instructions, sample scripts, and troubleshooting steps.

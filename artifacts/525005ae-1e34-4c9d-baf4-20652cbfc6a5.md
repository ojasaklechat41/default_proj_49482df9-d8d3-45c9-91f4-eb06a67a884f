# Product Requirements Artifact

**Product Requirements and User Stories for Pipelining Feature from Kafka to Firehose to Redshift**

### Product Requirements

1. **Data Flow Management**
   - The system should support efficient data pipelining from Kafka to Firehose and then to Redshift with minimal latency.
   - Provide a user-friendly dashboard for monitoring the real-time data flow between Kafka, Firehose, and Redshift.

2. **Flexibility and Scalability**
   - The architecture should be scalable to handle varying data loads.
   - Support for dynamic adjustment of the pipeline based on real-time data volume and processing needs.

3. **Error Handling**
   - Implement robust error handling mechanisms to manage data inconsistencies or failures during the transfer process.
   - Provide alerting mechanisms to notify users in case of pipeline failures or significant latency.

4. **Data Mapping and Transformation**
   - Enable users to define customized data transformation rules for data being transferred between systems.
   - Provide a visual interface for users to map fields from Kafka events to the appropriate fields in Redshift.

5. **Security**
   - Ensure end-to-end encryption of data in transit from Kafka to Firehose to Redshift.
   - Support AWS IAM roles and policies for fine-grained access control.

6. **Integration with Other AWS Services**
   - Allow seamless integration with Amazon S3 for intermediate file storage if needed.
   - Enable connectivity with Amazon Kinesis Firehose for dynamic data loading into Snowflake as an alternative.

7. **Performance Metrics**
   - Introduce analytics tools that provide insights into the efficiency and performance of the data pipeline.
   - Include metrics related to data latency, throughput, and error rates.

8. **User Documentation and Support**
   - Provide comprehensive documentation that includes how-to guides for setting up and optimizing the data pipeline.
   - Offer user support to assist with troubleshooting and optimization of pipeline configurations.

### User Stories

1. **As an end-user**, I want to see real-time data flow metrics on a dashboard, so that I can monitor the efficiency and health of the pipeline between Kafka and Redshift.

2. **As a data analyst**, I need the ability to define custom data transformation rules, so that I can ensure the data loaded into Redshift is structured according to our analytics needs.

3. **As a system administrator**, I want to set up automated alerts for any failures in the pipeline, so that I can act quickly to resolve issues and maintain data integrity.

4. **As a developer**, I want to ensure data is securely transmitted from Kafka to Firehose to Redshift, so that I can maintain compliance with data governance policies.

5. **As a business user**, I want to compare the effectiveness of our current data processing pipeline with ServiceNow and Jira, focusing on their capabilities, so that we can make an informed decision about potential migrations or upgrades.

6. **As a project manager**, I want to evaluate the integration of Amazon S3 and Kinesis Firehose with Snowflake, so that I can determine if it provides better optimization for our data processing compared to Redshift.

7. **As a website developer**, I need to build a secure networking site that leverages Snowflake's querying capabilities, so that users can engage with the data securely and efficiently.

8. **As a data engineer**, I want to adjust the pipeline configuration dynamically based on real-time data volume, so that we can ensure optimal performance without over-provisioning resources. 

By addressing these requirements and user stories, the product can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the data pipeline while meeting user expectations for performance and security.

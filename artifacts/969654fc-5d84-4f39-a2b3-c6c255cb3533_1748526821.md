# Gantt Chart Artifact

Creating a Gantt chart for a Proof of Concept (PoC) for an inventory management system and e-commerce website involves identifying key tasks, their durations, and dependencies. Below is a simplified overview of the project plan, including major tasks, timelines, and relationships among those tasks.

### Project Timeline: 
Assuming a project duration from **January 1, 2024, to March 31, 2024** (approximately 12 weeks).

### Gantt Chart Framework

| Task ID | Task                                     | Start Date   | End Date     | Duration (weeks) | Dependencies |
|---------|------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|------------------|--------------|
| 1       | Define Project Scope                     | Jan 1, 2024  | Jan 7, 2024  | 1                |              |
| 2       | Gather Requirements                      | Jan 8, 2024  | Jan 21, 2024 | 2                | 1            |
| 3       | Choose Tech Stack                       | Jan 22, 2024 | Jan 28, 2024 | 1                | 2            |
| 4       | Design Architecture                      | Jan 29, 2024 | Feb 4, 2024  | 1                | 3            |
| 5       | Develop User Registration Feature        | Feb 5, 2024  | Feb 18, 2024 | 2                | 4            |
| 6       | Develop Product Listings Feature         | Feb 19, 2024 | Mar 3, 2024  | 2                | 4            |
| 7       | Develop Shopping Cart Feature            | Mar 4, 2024  | Mar 17, 2024 | 2                | 5, 6         |
| 8       | Develop Checkout Process                 | Mar 18, 2024 | Mar 24, 2024 | 1                | 7            |
| 9       | Testing and QA                          | Mar 25, 2024 | Mar 31, 2024 | 1                | 8            |

### Summary of Key Tasks:

1. **Define Project Scope**: Establish the goals and objectives of the PoC, including all necessary features and functionality.
2. **Gather Requirements**: Collect detailed requirements from stakeholders to ensure the system meets user needs.
3. **Choose Tech Stack**: Evaluate and select the appropriate technologies, frameworks, and tools to be used in the PoC.
4. **Design Architecture**: Create a preliminary architecture diagram to outline how different components will interact.
5. **Develop Features**: Sequentially develop features for user registration, product listings, shopping cart, and checkout.
6. **Testing and QA**: Conduct testing to identify and fix any issues before presentation.

### Dependencies Explanation:
- Task 2 (Gather Requirements) cannot start until Task 1 (Define Project Scope) is complete.
- Task 3 (Choose Tech Stack) depends on Task 2 (Gather Requirements).
- Task 4 (Design Architecture) relies on the completion of Task 3 (Choose Tech Stack).
- Feature developments (Tasks 5, 6, 7, and 8) are sequential and in some cases parallel but require the architecture to be in place first.

### Visual Representation:
You can use Gantt chart software (like Microsoft Project, Asana, or Trello) to visually represent the timeline and tasks listed above. The tasks would be plotted along a horizontal timeline with bars indicating the duration of each task and lines or arrows showing dependencies. 

This should give you a comprehensive view of the steps you need to take for your PoC, ensuring that all the critical tasks are aligned for timely delivery.
